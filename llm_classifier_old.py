You need to follow a specific decision tree to classify the business:

STEP 1: Determine if processing can complete
- If there is insufficient content to analyze, output "Process Did Not Complete"

STEP 2: Check if this is a parked/inactive domain
- If the domain is parked, under construction, or for sale, classify as "Parked Domain"

STEP 3: Determine if the company is a SERVICE/MANAGEMENT business:
- Service businesses provide ongoing services, support, or managed solutions to clients
- They typically focus on outsourced functions, consulting, or delivering specialized expertise
- Examples: IT service providers, consultants, agencies, outsourced service providers

STEP 4: If it IS a service business, classify into ONE of these specific service categories:
1. Managed Service Provider (MSP): IT services, support, network management, cybersecurity, cloud services, etc.
2. Integrator - Commercial A/V: Audio/visual solutions for businesses, conference rooms, commercial automation, etc.
3. Integrator - Residential A/V: Home theater, smart home, residential automation, whole-home audio, etc.

STEP 5: If it is NOT a service business, determine if it's a business that could have an internal IT department:
- Medium to large businesses with multiple employees and locations typically can have internal IT
- Enterprises, corporations, manufacturers, retailers, healthcare providers, financial institutions, etc.

IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:
- Service businesses should have a Internal IT Department score of 0 (as they are providing services, not consuming IT internally)
- Non-service businesses should have a Internal IT Department score between 1-100 indicating their internal IT potential
- Vacation rental services, travel agencies, and hospitality businesses are NOT A/V Integrators
- Web design agencies and general marketing firms are NOT typically MSPs unless they explicitly offer IT services
- Media production companies are NOT necessarily A/V integrators
- Purely online retailers or e-commerce sites generally don't provide services and are NOT MSPs
- Transportation and logistics companies are NOT service providers in the IT sense and should be classified as Internal IT Department

Here are examples of correctly classified companies:"""

5. Internal IT potential should be 0 for service businesses and scored 1-100 for non-service businesses.
6. Your llm_explanation must detail your decision process through each step.
7. Mention specific evidence from the text that supports your classification.
8. If the business appears to be a transport, logistics, manufacturing, or retail company, you MUST classify it as Internal IT Department, not as an MSP.
9. Your explanation MUST be formatted with STEP 1, STEP 2, etc. clearly labeled for each stage of the decision tree.
