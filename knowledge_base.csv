Read more IT Executives Learn How Simplegrid's IT Support in New York City, New Jersey and Philadelphia can help augment your expertise, so that you can focus on the Business of IT. Read more Are You Looking For A New IT Support Partner in New York City, New Jersey, or Philadelphia? There’s Something You Should Know... Dear Fellow CEO, – You are about to TRUST someone with one of the most important operational decisions for your business: Who should you give the authority to access, maintain and manage your company’s critical data and IT systems? Your IT support decision, if mishandled or granted to the wrong person, could turn into a number of time-consuming, costly and irritating problems for you, including endless technical “glitches,” extended downtime, errors, slowness and possibly even critical data loss or security breaches. If you don’t want that kind of stress in your life, then for managed IT services in New York City, New Jersey, or Philadelphia you should ONLY call Simplegrid Technology, Inc.. However, we are not a right fit for everyone. Therefore, in the spirit of saving time for both of us, I submit to you the following checklist to help you identify if our services would be ideal for you…or not. The following are the types of people who seek us out and gain the greatest benefit from our services: Exceptionally Busy CEOs Of Successful, Fast-Growth Firms Why? Because we know that with so many pressing deadlines and demands on your time, you need someone who will just get things done right and fast. In fact, that’s why our IT support and service plans are designed to take complete responsibility for everything IT-related in your business. Our #1 goal is to minimize your involvement in any technical problems and eliminate anything that would slow down productivity and progress. You won’t hear us telling you “that’s not our problem,” “we can’t handle that for you” or “you’ll have to call XYZ company to get that problem resolved.” We simply get it done and don’t quibble over who caused it or whose problem it is. If you’re the kind of CEO who just wants to have everything handled, we’re ideal for you. However, if you are the kind of person who wants to try to manage your IT support and systems on your own to save a bit of money and only call us in when you run into a roadblock or problem you can’t resolve, then we won’t be an ideal fit for you. CEOs Who Want Things Done RIGHT, Not Cheap Why? Our best clients are the ones who want things done RIGHT the first time so they don’t have to deal with do-overs and wasted time. They would rather invest a bit more in the right tools, technology and infrastructure up front than try to save every penny. That’s not to suggest that our best clients are foolish in their budgets and spending—just the opposite. They simply know that a quality system and the right plan are far more important than saving a couple of bucks. CEOs Who Want A Competent, Professional PARTNER Why? Because they hire and run their business with teams and appreciate our Team System for providing exceptional IT support in New York and New Jersey. They know that the most dangerous number in business is “one.” They also know that no one person has the answer to every single problem, and that difficult problems are best solved when a highly competent and experienced team of professionals come together to resolve it. They also want a partner that will fully understand how their business runs so that they can effectively manage it services and make recommendations on technology solutions that will help make their business more profitable. If we sound like a good fit for you, I encourage you to call our office and request a 21 Point IT Support and Service Check List of items you should DEMAND from your IT Service Provider in New York and New Jersey. This process will help you assure you are getting the absolute best service from a competent IT Team.

The council is so grateful, and weâve built a wonderful rapport with them. They all deserve a big pat on the back!B&F Contracts & Compliance Unit, City of Moreton BayMonique S.Pro AV Solutions delivered a video wall replacement project across three rooms in our Rail Management Centre. The main control room contains a 24-metre-long wall which displays the location of every single train in real-time for the entire Southeast Queensland network (one of the largest television screens in the Southern Hemisphere). The training room contains a 17-metre-long wall. The Security Room contains a 7-metre-long wall. From the moment we met Gavin and the team, the project came to life seamlessly. They worked with us under difficult time constraints, including night works and within a 24/7 operational environment. The quality of the products is high and improved the glare dramatically. Pro AV met all deadlines and exceeded expectations with their high level of engagement and communication. They were a pleasure to work alongside in this video wall replacement project.Queensland RailHelena H.I would like to commend PAVS services. Tasked with a problem that has no obvious cause, PAVS refused to surrender. Its unlikely we would have ever found this issue ourselves, and without the effort and determination we would have been placed in a less than desired position for a major event this week. PAVS kept a positive and driven approach and when resolved was a relief to many faces which were greatly appreciated.St Johns GrammarJacob H.Just wanted to let you know that we have had nothing but good things to say about our experiences with PAVS. The team have been very efficient and diligent, well organised, good attitude and just overall easy for us to work with, definately on brand with all the values of your organisation.University of AdelaideMartin Q.Team Pro AV, we couldnt have done it without your dedication, professionalism and commitment to the quality and more importantly, satisfying the end users requirements.
